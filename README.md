# 📊 Jellycat Regional Revenue 
### 🎯 Goal
This project explores Jellycat Đà Nẵng’s business performance through the lens of data — uncovering revenue trends, product-level insights, and hidden leaks in profitability.

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains 4,794 records across the following fields:
Year | Month | Store Name | Region | Store Type | Product Name | Product Category | Units Sold | Revenue | Profit

# 🔍 The Story Unfolds
Once a steadily growing region, Jellycat Đà Nẵng hit a notable revenue drop in September 2024:

📉 -11.6% compared to August
📉 -8.7% compared to the same month last year

This decline sparked a deeper look — and the data spoke clearly:

🧸 Product dependence is risky: A few bestsellers are driving the majority of revenue, while underperforming products are dragging profitability unnoticed.

🛍️ Store-level losses are hidden: Locations like Bé Yêu and Vincom quietly erode performance.

⚠️ Revenue is fragile: A dip in just one top product leads to a significant drop in total revenue.

# ✅ Recommendations
To steer Đà Nẵng’s revenue back on course, the data suggests:

🏪 Audit low-performing stores (e.g., Bé Yêu, Vincom) for operational inefficiencies.

🎯 Launch targeted promotions to revive sales of high-loss items.

🚀 Amplify winners: Increase availability and exposure of top performers like Nerf Gun.

🌱 Diversify the portfolio to avoid over-reliance on a narrow product range.

### 📌 Why it Matters
This analysis shows how data storytelling transforms numbers into strategy — turning insights into actions that help businesses adapt, grow, and thrive.
